## üßÆ Medical Calculators - Practical Examples

### BMI Calculator
**When to use**: Patient assessments, nutrition counseling, health screenings

**Example scenario**:
- Patient: 25-year-old female, 65kg, 1.62m
- Ask AI: "Calculate BMI for 65kg, 1.62m"
- Result: BMI = 24.8 (Normal weight)
- **Clinical note**: Patient is at upper limit of normal BMI, consider lifestyle counseling

### GFR Calculator
**When to use**: Kidney function assessment, medication dosing, nephrology

**Example scenario**:
- Patient: 70-year-old male, 80kg, Creatinine 1.8 mg/dL
- Ask AI: "Calculate GFR for 70 years, 80kg, creatinine 1.8"
- Result: GFR ‚âà 35 (Stage 3b CKD)
- **Clinical note**: Adjust medication doses, monitor kidney function

### CHADS2 Score
**When to use**: Atrial fibrillation management, stroke prevention

**Example scenario**:
- Patient: 75 years, Hypertension, Diabetes, Previous stroke
- Ask AI: "Calculate CHADS2 score for 75 years, HTN, DM, previous stroke"
- Result: CHADS2 = 6 (High risk)
- **Clinical note**: Strong indication for anticoagulation

## üíä Drug Information - Learning Approach

### Study Method
1. **Start with drug classes** (e.g., "Tell me about beta-blockers")
2. **Learn mechanisms** (how they work)
3. **Understand side effects** (what to watch for)
4. **Know interactions** (what to avoid)

### Practical Examples
**Ask the AI**:
- "What are the main side effects of ACE inhibitors?"
- "How do beta-blockers work in heart failure?"
- "What drugs interact with warfarin?"
- "What's the mechanism of action of statins?"

## üîç Symptom Education - Learning Approach

### Important Disclaimer
‚ö†Ô∏è **This is for educational purposes only. Always consult healthcare professionals for actual symptoms.**

### Study Method
1. **Learn symptom patterns** (what symptoms go together)
2. **Understand red flags** (when to seek immediate care)
3. **Practice differential diagnosis** (what could cause this)
4. **Know when to refer** (when you need specialist input)

### Practical Examples
**Ask the AI**:
- "What are the red flags for chest pain?"
- "What symptoms suggest meningitis?"
- "How do you differentiate between viral and bacterial infections?"
- "What are the warning signs of heart failure?"
