      `Dengue Fever - Comprehensive Medical Education for Medical Students

Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral infection caused by dengue virus (DENV 1-4), transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquito, endemic in Sri Lanka.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:
- Flavivirus with 4 serotypes (DENV 1-4)
- Primary infection provides lifelong immunity to that serotype
- Secondary infection with different serotype increases risk of severe disease
- Immune enhancement theory: pre-existing antibodies enhance viral replication
- Endothelial dysfunction leads to plasma leakage and shock

CLINICAL FEATURES:
- Incubation period: 4-7 days
- Febrile phase (days 1-3): High fever (39-40°C), severe headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea, vomiting
- Critical phase (days 4-6): Plasma leakage, thrombocytopenia, hemoconcentration

      `Dengue Fever - Comprehensive Medical Education for Medical Students

Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral infection caused by dengue virus (DENV 1-4), transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquito, endemic in Sri Lanka.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:
- Flavivirus with 4 serotypes (DENV 1-4)
- Primary infection provides lifelong immunity to that serotype
- Secondary infection with different serotype increases risk of severe disease
- Immune enhancement theory: pre-existing antibodies enhance viral replication
- Endothelial dysfunction leads to plasma leakage and shock

CLINICAL FEATURES:
- Incubation period: 4-7 days
- Febrile phase (days 1-3): High fever (39-40°C), severe headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea, vomiting
- Critical phase (days 4-6): Plasma leakage, thrombocytopenia, hemoconcentration
- Recovery phase (days 7-10): Reabsorption of fluid, diuresis
